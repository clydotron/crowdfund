Crowdfund

Kickstarter meets blockchain. Small application that uses Etherium as currency for crowd funded campaigns. Intended to reduce the fraud/abuse of Kickstarter by requiring that contributors/supporter approve any payment requests by the manager.
Basic flow:
Manger creates the campaign, and specifies a minumum amout of wei that folks can contribute.
Individuals can contribute to the campaign.
Manager creates 'requests' to spend/transfer the ether
Once a majority of the contributors have approved the request, it can be finalized (and payed)

Technologies invovled:
Solidity: Etherium contract
